# Python-Downloader
A tool to automatically download and setup Python on multiple OSes.

I wrote this tool for practice and to eventually have a customizable toolset that
allowed me to "Re"-install all of my applications with one click (just the way I want).
Eventually a spinoff of this tool will create directories and subdirectories that I use when
programming etc.

Future Features:
A simple language\instruction set for the program to follow to download\verify and install programs.
Folder structure recreation.
Dropbox or other integration to download files from the web and insert them into their correct directories.
